This means that everything in the universe is pulling on everything else, but the effect is most noticeable with very massive objects like planets and stars.\n\n2. **Strength of Gravity**: The more mass an object has, the stronger its gravitational pull. For example, the Earth has a much stronger gravitational pull than the Moon because it has more mass.\n\n3. **Distance Matters**: The farther apart two objects are, the weaker the gravitational pull between them. This is why the Sun, which is very massive, doesn't pull us off the Earth\u2014because we're so far away from it.\n\n4. **Effect on Motion**: Gravity causes objects to fall to the ground when dropped, keeps planets in orbit around the Sun, and holds",

Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n   \\[\n   F = G \\frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}\n   \\]\n   where \\(F\\) is the force of gravity, \\(G\\) is the gravitational constant, \\(m_1\\) and \\(m_2\\) are the masses of the two objects, and \\(r\\) is the distance between their centers.\n\n2. **",

It is one of the fundamental particles in the universe and is the carrier of the electromagnetic force. Here are some key points about photons:\n\n1. **Quantum Nature**: Photons are quantum particles, meaning they exhibit both wave-like and particle-like properties. This dual nature was first proposed by Albert Einstein in 1905 to explain the photoelectric effect, for which he later won the Nobel Prize.\n\n2. **Energy and Frequency**: The energy of a photon is directly proportional to its frequency. This relationship is given by the equation:\n   \\[\n   E = h \\nu\n   \\]\n   where \\( E \\) is the energy of the photon, \\( h \\) is Planck's constant (approximately \\( 6.626 \\times 10^{-34}",
